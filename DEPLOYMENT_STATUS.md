3. **Progress Feedback**: Status messages during upload and submission
4. **Linear Integration**: Files are uploaded to Linear and linked in issues
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if file uploads fail

## File Upload Specifications

- **Max Files**: 5 files per submission
- **Supported Types**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, CSV, XLSX

## API Endpoints Now Available

## Ready for Production Use
The updated feedback form with file upload functionality is now deployed and ready for production use. Users can:

1. Access the feedback form via the portal
2. Fill out the standard form fields (name, email, subject, type, comment)
3. Upload files using the new drag-and-drop interface
4. Submit feedback which will create a Linear issue with file attachments

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility - existing feedback submissions will continue to work exactly as before, while new submissions can optionally include file attachments.

## Next Steps
- Monitor Linear issues to verify file attachments are working correctly
- Update user documentation to inform about the new file upload capability
- Consider adding file type icons and upload progress bars for enhanced UX
